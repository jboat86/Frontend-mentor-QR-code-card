## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I learnt how to how to use flexbox and i also had the chance to play around with rem units when declaring the font size 
Listed below is an example of applying flexbox to the body of the main web page of the QR-code component.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

body {
  height: calc(100vh -1px);
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  background-color: var(--light-gray);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  font-size: 15px;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 1.25rem;
}


### Continued development

Although i have built this compnent with pure CSS, i'm aiming to learn CSS frameworks such as Sass. Besides CSS, i'm also learning Javascript. Once i get comfortable with the basic frontend languages i wish to expand my skillset by learning a js framework, react and other languages such as Python.
